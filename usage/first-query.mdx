This guide walks you through making your first SEC EDGAR query, from setup to analyzing real financial data.

## Before You Begin

<Check>
  Make sure you have:
  - SEC EDGAR MCP installed and configured
  - Your SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT environment variable set
  - An MCP client connected to SEC EDGAR MCP
</Check>

## Step 1: Test the Connection

Start with a simple query to verify everything is working:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language">
    In your AI assistant, type:
    ```text
    What is Apple's CIK number?
    ```
    
    Expected response:
    ```text
    Apple's CIK number is 0000320193
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Direct Tool Call">
    ```json
    {
      "tool": "get_cik_by_ticker",
      "arguments": {
        "ticker": "AAPL"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Expected response:
    ```json
    {
      "cik": "0000320193",
      "ticker": "AAPL",
      "title": "Apple Inc."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Get Company Information

Now let's get more detailed company information:

```text
Show me Apple's recent filing history
```

The assistant will:
1. Use `get_cik_by_ticker` to get Apple's CIK
2. Call `get_submissions` to retrieve filing history
3. Present a summary of recent filings

You should see information about:
- Recent 10-K (annual reports)
- 10-Q (quarterly reports)
- 8-K (current reports)
- Other SEC filings

## Step 3: Retrieve a Specific Filing

Let's get Apple's latest annual report:

```text
Get me Apple's most recent 10-K filing and show me the business description
```

<Info>
  The assistant will use multiple tools in sequence:
  1. `get_cik_by_ticker` - Get CIK
  2. `get_recent_filings_smart` - Find latest 10-K
  3. `get_filing_txt_sections` - Extract business section
</Info>

## Step 4: Analyze Financial Data

Now for some financial analysis:

```text
What was Apple's revenue for the last 4 quarters?
```

The assistant will use `get_specific_concept_values` to retrieve quarterly revenue data and present it in an easy-to-read format.

## Step 5: Compare Financial Metrics

Let's do a year-over-year comparison:

```text
Compare Apple's net income between 2023 and 2024
```

This will trigger the `compare_concept_periods` tool to show:
- 2023 net income
- 2024 net income
- Percentage change
- Analysis of the trend

## Complete Example Workflow

Here's a complete analysis workflow you can try:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Company Overview">
    ```text
    Give me an overview of Microsoft including their business segments
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Financial Performance">
    ```text
    Show me Microsoft's revenue and profit margins for the last year
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Segment Analysis">
    ```text
    Break down Microsoft's revenue by business segment
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Recent News">
    ```text
    What recent 8-K filings has Microsoft made?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Tool Responses

When the assistant uses SEC EDGAR MCP tools, you'll see structured data like:

### Company Data Example
```json
{
  "name": "Apple Inc.",
  "cik": "0000320193",
  "tickers": ["AAPL"],
  "sic": "3571",
  "sicDescription": "Electronic Computers"
}
```

### Financial Data Example
```json
{
  "concept": "RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax",
  "values": [
    {
      "value": 119575000000,
      "period": {
        "endDate": "2024-09-30",
        "months": 3
      },
      "form": "10-Q"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting Your First Query

<Warning>
  If your queries aren't working, check these common issues:
</Warning>

### Query Not Returning Data

1. **Check the ticker symbol**: Ensure you're using the correct NYSE/NASDAQ ticker
2. **Verify the company is public**: Private companies don't file with SEC
3. **Check the filing type**: Not all companies file all form types

### Rate Limiting

If you see rate limit errors:
- Wait 10 seconds between requests
- Reduce the number of concurrent queries
- Check your SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT is properly set

### No Financial Data

Some companies may not report standard XBRL concepts:
- Try different concept names
- Check if the company uses custom concepts
- Look at the actual filing to verify data exists

## Tips for Effective Queries

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    Instead of "Show me Apple's financials", try:
    "Show me Apple's quarterly revenue for the last year"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Time Frames">
    Specify periods for better results:
    "Get Tesla's Q3 2024 earnings" vs "Get Tesla's earnings"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Combine Analyses">
    Ask for multiple related items:
    "Compare Apple and Samsung's revenue and show me their profit margins"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Iterate and Refine">
    Start broad, then drill down:
    1. "Show me Microsoft's segments"
    2. "Give me more detail on the Azure segment"
    3. "How fast is Azure growing year-over-year?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
